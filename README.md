## BeatMetrics Music Recommendation App

## Project Summary
Our web application redefines the music listening experience with a plethora of features aimed at making it more enjoyable and personalized. Users can easily create and manage playlists, collaborate with others, and explore music tailored to their mood and preferences. We provide insightful statistics, offering a glimpse into their music habits, from favored genres to peak listening hours. As a bonus, premium users can unlock offline listening for an uninterrupted experience.

What sets us apart is our innovative Tinder-like feature for music discovery. Users can swipe right for songs they love, left for those they don't, or simply skip tracks they're undecided about. These swipes shape personalized recommendations based on various song attributes like artist, genre, energy, and more. This engaging feature adds a fun twist to music discovery, setting our platform apart from the rest.

Our application also offers seamless login options, intuitive exploration, and in-depth dashboard insights. Playlist creation is a breeze, with each playlist having its dedicated schema. Users can invite others to join playlists through smart database relationships. Explore top songs, trends, and even filter them by artist popularity or streams per song. Our premium tier, accessible via Stripe, grants exclusive features like offline listening, catering to the diverse needs of music enthusiasts.
